### Port Forwarding (YOU NEED THIS, TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE INTERNET(only for servers/pcs at home):
- If You don't know How: portforward.com
- 7777 UDP - Default Game Port
- 27015 UDP - Default Query (or TCP, not sure)
- 8766 UDP/TCP - Default Steam Port (not sure if forward is needed)
- 8889 TCP - Default Webserver Port (not sure if forward is needed)

### Not having an full IPv4 adress ( named CCNAT or DSL Light )
No game or gameserver supports ipv6 only connections. 
- You need to either buy one (most VPN services provide that option. A pal uses ovpn.net for his server, I know of nordvpn also providing that. Should both cost around 7€ cheaper half of it, if your already having an VPN)
- Or you pay a bit more for your internet and take a contract with full ipv4. (depending on your country)
- There are also tunneling methods, which require acces to a server with a full ipv4. Some small VPS can be obtained, not powerfull enough for the servers themself, but only for forwarding. I think there are some for under 5€), the connection is then done via wireguard. but its a bit configuration heavy to setup) 

Or you connect your friends via VPN to your net and play via local lan then.
Many windowsgsm plugin creators recommend zerotier (should be a free VPN designated for gaming) , see chapter below (or tailscale, but no howto there)

## How can you play with your friends without port forwarding?
- Use [zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) folow the basic guide and create network
- Download the client app and join to your network
- Create static IP address for your host machine
- Edit WGSM IP Address to your recently created static IP address
- Give your network ID to your friends
- After they've joined to your network
- They can connect using the IP you've created eg: 10.123.17.1:7777
- Enjoy
